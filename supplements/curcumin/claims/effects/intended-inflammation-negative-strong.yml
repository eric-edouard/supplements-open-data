    - "A meta-analyses of ten studies with 5,870 participants indicated a
      significant decrease in C-reactive protein (CRP) (ES = −0.74; 95% CI:
      −1.11, −0.37, p < 0.001; I2 = 62.1%, p=0.015), interleukin 6 (IL-6) (ES =
      −1.07; 95% CI: −1.71, −0.44, p < 0.001; I2 = 75.6%, p < 0.001), and tumour
      necrosis factor α (TNF-α) levels (ES: −1.92, 95% CI: −2.64, −1.19, p <
      0.0; I2 = 18.1%, p=0.296) following curcumin supplementation"
    - The umbrella of meta-analysis suggests curcumin as a promising agent in
      reducing inflammation as an adjunctive therapeutic approach in diseases
      whose pathogenesis is related to a higher level of inflammatory biomarkers
