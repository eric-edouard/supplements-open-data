  abstract:
    - thiol compounds can inhibit enzymatic activity by binding to copper ions
      at the active site of TYR, and act as an antioxidant scavenging reactive
      oxygen species and free radicals or as a modulator of redox balance,
      thereby inhibiting overall melanin synthesis
    - This review will cover the metabolic aspects of thiol compounds, the role
      of thiol compounds in melanin synthesis, comparison of the antimelanogenic
      effects of various thiol compounds
effect: pigmentation-evenness
kind: intended
direction: positive
strength: moderate
