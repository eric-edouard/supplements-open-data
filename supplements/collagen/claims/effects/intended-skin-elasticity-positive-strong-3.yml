  abstract:
    - "Following 12 weeks daily use of the AC supplement, using confocal microscopy, we observed a significant 44.6% decrease in fragmentation vs. placebo (p < 0.01)"
    - "We also measured a change in the ultrasound LEP (low echogenic pixel) ratio comparing upper and lower dermis (−9.24 vs. −7.83, respectively, p=0.05), suggesting collagen improvements occurred more in the upper dermal compartment"

effect: skin-elasticity
kind: intended
direction: positive
