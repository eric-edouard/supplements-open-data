  abstract:
    - "A single dose of AlphaWave®l-Theanine significantly increased frontal region alpha power compared to placebo in response to an acute stress challenge. These changes are indicative of relaxation in the brain and suggest a calming response"
    - "The changes in alpha wave activity are supported by greater decreases in salivary cortisol 1 h post-dose (p < 0.001) with AlphaWave®l-Theanine compared to placebo"
    - "A single dose of AlphaWave®l-Theanine (200 mg) or placebo was administered"
