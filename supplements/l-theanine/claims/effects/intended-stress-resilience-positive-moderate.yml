  abstract:
    - A single dose of AlphaWave®l-Theanine significantly increased frontal
      region alpha power compared to placebo in response to an acute stress
      challenge. These changes are indicative of relaxation in the brain and
      suggest a calming response
    - The changes in alpha wave activity are supported by greater decreases in
      salivary cortisol 1 h post-dose (p < 0.001) with AlphaWave®l-Theanine
      compared to placebo
    - A single dose of AlphaWave®l-Theanine (200 mg) or placebo was administered
