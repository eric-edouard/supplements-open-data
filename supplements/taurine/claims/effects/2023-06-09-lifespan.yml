  abstract:
    - A reversal of this decline through taurine supplementation increased the
      health span (the period of healthy living) and life span in mice and
      health span in monkeys.
    - The median life span of taurine-treated mice increased by 10 to 12%, and
      life expectancy at 28 months increased by about 18 to 25%.
