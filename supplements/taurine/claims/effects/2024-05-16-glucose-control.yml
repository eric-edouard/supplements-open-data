  abstract:
    - "Compared to control groups, taurine supplementation demonstrated
      statistically significant reductions in SBP (weighted mean difference
      [WMD] = −3.999 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −7.293 to −0.706, p =
      0.017), DBP (WMD = −1.509 mmHg, 95% CI = −2.479 to −0.539, p = 0.002), FBG
      (WMD: −5.882 mg/dL, 95% CI: −10.747 to −1.018, p = 0.018)"
