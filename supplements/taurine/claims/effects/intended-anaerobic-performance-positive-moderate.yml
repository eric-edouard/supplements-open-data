  abstract:
    - "Key results include improvements in the following: VO 2 max, time to exhaustion (TTE; n = 5 articles), 3 or 4 km time-trial ( n = 2 articles), anaerobic performance ( n = 7 articles)"
    - Taurine dosing appears to be effective at ~ 1–3 g/day acutely across a span of 6–15 days (1–3 h before an activity) which may improve aerobic performance (TTE), anaerobic performance (strength, power)
