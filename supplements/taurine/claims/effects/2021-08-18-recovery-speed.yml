  abstract:
    - From the selected literature, we observed that taurine supplementation (2
      g three times daily) with exercise can decrease DNA damage.
    - Finally, we observed that a low dose of taurine (0.05 g) before performing
      strength enhancing exercises can decrease muscular fatigue and increase
      enzymatic antioxidants.
