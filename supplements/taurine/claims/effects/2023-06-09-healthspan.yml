  abstract:
    - A reversal of this decline through taurine supplementation increased the
      health span (the period of healthy living) and life span in mice and
      health span in monkeys.
    - We, therefore, investigated the health of taurine-fed middle-aged mice and
      found an improved functioning of bone, muscle, pancreas, brain, fat, gut,
      and immune system, indicating an overall increase in health span.
