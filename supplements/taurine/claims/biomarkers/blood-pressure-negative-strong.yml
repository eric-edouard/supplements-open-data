  abstract:
    - Compared to control groups, taurine supplementation demonstrated statistically significant reductions in SBP (weighted mean difference [WMD] = −3.999 mmHg, 95% confidence interval [CI] = −7.293 to −0.706, p = 0.017), DBP (WMD = −1.509 mmHg, 95% CI = −2.479 to −0.539, p = 0.002)
    - The daily dosage of taurine in the studies ranged from 0.5 g/day to 6 g/day, with follow-up periods varying between 5 and 365 days
