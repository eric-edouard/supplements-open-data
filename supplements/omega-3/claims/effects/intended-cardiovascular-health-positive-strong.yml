  abstract:
    - it is proposed that a n-3 FA biomarker, the omega-3 index (erythrocyte
      eicosapentaenoic acid plus docosahexaenoic acid), be considered as a
      potential risk factor for coronary heart disease mortality, especially
      sudden cardiac death
    - "Proposed omega-3 index risk zones are (in percentages of erythrocyte
      FAs): high risk, <4%; intermediate risk, 4-8%; and low risk, >8%"
