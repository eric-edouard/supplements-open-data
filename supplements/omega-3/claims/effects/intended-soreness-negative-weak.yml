  abstract:
    - "Meta-analysis revealed a significantly decreased DOMS (MD -0.93; 95% CI -1.44, -0.42; P = 0.0004) in n‐3 PUFA supplement groups"
    - "However, the pooled effect size for DOMS was lower than the minimal clinically important difference (MCID) of 1.4 on the 10-unit VAS, suggesting that the effect size of less muscle soreness with n‐3 PUFA supplements did not appear to be clinically relevant"
