  abstract:
    - "Elevated glycine led to a small (4%â€“6%) but statistically significant lifespan increase, as well as an increase in maximum lifespan, in both males (p = 0.002) and females (p < 0.001)"
    - "Our glycine results strengthen the idea that modulation of dietary amino acid levels can increase healthy lifespan in mice"

effect: autophagy
kind: intended
direction: positive
description: "Glycine supplementation is associated with lifespan extension, which involves autophagy modulation as a hallmark of aging"
