  abstract:
    - "GlyNAC supplementation for 24 weeks in OA corrected RBC‐GSH deficiency, OxS, and mitochondrial dysfunction; and improved inflammation, endothelial dysfunction, insulin‐resistance, genomic‐damage, cognition, strength, gait‐speed, and exercise capacity"
    - "This pilot trial in OA was conducted to test the effect of GlyNAC supplementation and withdrawal on intracellular GSH concentrations, OxS, MFO, inflammation, endothelial function, genotoxicity, muscle and glucose metabolism, body composition, strength, and cognition"

effect: muscle-strength
kind: intended
direction: positive
