  abstract:
    - Elevated glycine led to a small (4%â€“6%) but statistically significant
      lifespan increase, as well as an increase in maximum lifespan, in both
      males (p = 0.002) and females (p < 0.001)
    - Pooling across sex, glycine increased lifespan at each of the three
      independent sites, with significance at p = 0.01, 0.053, and 0.03,
      respectively
effect: lifespan
kind: intended
direction: positive
strength: strong
p_value: 0.001
