  abstract:
    - The results showed that glycinamide enhanced collagen production (secreted
      collagen level) most effectively. Glycine also enhanced collagen
      production to a lesser degree
    - Glycinamide increased type I and III collagen protein levels without
      affecting COL1A1 and COL3A1 mRNA levels
effect: skin-hydration
