  abstract:
    - We further show that supplementation of glycine significantly prolongs C.
      elegans lifespan and ameliorates specific transcriptional changes that are
      associated with aging
    - These results provide a novel role for glycine as a promoter of longevity
      and bring new insight into the role of one-carbon amino acids in the
      regulation of aging
