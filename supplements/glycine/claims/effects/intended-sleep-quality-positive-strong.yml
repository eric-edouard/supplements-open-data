  abstract:
    - Glycine improved subjective sleep quality and sleep efficacy (sleep
      time/in-bed time), and shortened PSG latency both to sleep onset and to
      slow wave sleep without changes in the sleep architecture
    - In human volunteers who have been continuously experiencing unsatisfactory
      sleep, effects of glycine ingestion (3 g) before bedtime on subjective
      sleep quality were investigated
effect: sleep-quality
kind: intended
direction: positive
strength: strong
dosage:
  unit: milligram
  value: 3000
timing: bedtime
