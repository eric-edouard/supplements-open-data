  abstract:
    - We find that mutations in components of this cycle, methionine synthase
      (metr-1) and S-adenosylmethionine synthetase (sams-1), completely abrogate
      glycine-induced lifespan extension
    - Taken together, these data uncover a novel role of glycine in the
      deceleration of aging through its function in the methionine cycle
effect: healthspan
