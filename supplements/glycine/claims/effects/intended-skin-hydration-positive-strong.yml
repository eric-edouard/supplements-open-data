    - The intake of collagen proteins result in higher plasma peaks of glycine,
      whilst the intake of dairy proteins result in higher plasma peaks of
      leucine
    - collagen proteins being a superior source of glycine (683 ± 166 μmol/L)
      compared to 260 ± 65 μmol/L for dairy proteins (P < 0.0001)
