  abstract:
    - GlyNAC supplementation for 24 weeks in OA corrected RBC‐GSH deficiency,
      OxS, and mitochondrial dysfunction
    - We previously reported that inducing deficiency of the antioxidant
      tripeptide glutathione (GSH) in young mice results in mitochondrial
      dysfunction, and that supplementing GlyNAC (combination of glycine and
      N‐acetylcysteine [NAC]) in aged mice improves naturally‐occurring GSH
      deficiency
biomarker: glutathione
direction: positive
strength: strong
