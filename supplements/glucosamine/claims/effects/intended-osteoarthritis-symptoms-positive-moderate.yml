  abstract:
    - Trials of glucosamine and chondroitin preparations for OA symptoms
      demonstrate moderate to large effects, but quality issues and likely
      publication bias suggest that these effects are exaggerated
    - Nevertheless, some degree of efficacy appears probable for these
      preparations
    - The aggregated effect sizes were 0.44 (95% confidence interval [CI],
      0.24-0.64) for glucosamine
effect: osteoarthritis-symptoms
kind: intended
direction: positive
strength: moderate
