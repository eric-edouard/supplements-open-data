  abstract:
    - There is enough evidence to prove that ginger possesses multiple
      biological activities, especially antioxidant and anti-inflammatory
      capacities
    - We can conclude that the compounds 6-shoagol, zingerone, and 8-shoagol
      display promising results in human and animal models, reducing some of the
      main symptoms of some inflammatory diseases such as arthritis
    - Ginger decreases NF-kÎ² in psoriasis, and its short-term administration may
      be an alternative coadjuvant treatment
