  abstract:
    - "High intakes and high levels of lycopene compared to low amounts were, respectively, associated with 5% (Pooled RR: 0.95, 95% CI: 0.92–0.98, I2 = 26.4%, p = 0.002) and 11% (Pooled RR: 0.89, 95% CI: 0.84–0.95, I2 = 15.0%, p < 0.001) reduction in overall cancer risk"
    - "Also, each 10 μg/dL increase in blood levels of lycopene was associated with a 5% lower risk of overall cancer"
