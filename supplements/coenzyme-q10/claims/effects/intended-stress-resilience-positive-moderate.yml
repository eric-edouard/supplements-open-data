  abstract:
    - As compared with the placebo groups evaluated in each RCT, the CoQ10 group
      showed a statistically significant reduction in fatigue scores (Hedges' g
      = −0.398, 95% confidence interval = −0.641 to −0.155, p = 0.001)
    - The results of our meta-regression demonstrate that increases in the daily
      dose (coefficient = −0.0017 per mg, p < 0.001) and treatment duration
      (coefficient = −0.0042 per day, p = 0.007) of CoQ10 supplementation were
      correlated with greater fatigue reduction
    - Based on the results of this meta-analysis, we conclude that CoQ10 is an
      effective and safe supplement for reducing fatigue symptoms
