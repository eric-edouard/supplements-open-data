  abstract:
    - "We show in this review evidence of the relationship of magnesium with all the hallmarks of aging (genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, altered intercellular communication, disabled autophagy, dysbiosis, and chronic inflammation)"
    - "which may positively affect the human healthspan"
    - "It is feasible to hypothesize that maintaining an optimal balance of magnesium during one's life course may turn out to be a safe and economical strategy contributing to the promotion of healthy aging."
