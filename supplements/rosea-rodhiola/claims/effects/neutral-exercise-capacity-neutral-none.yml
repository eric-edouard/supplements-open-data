    - Two of six trials examining physical fatigue in healthy populations report
      R. rosea to be effective
    - Research regarding R. rosea efficacy is contradictory. While some evidence
      suggests that the herb may be helpful for enhancing physical performance
      and alleviating mental fatigue, methodological flaws limit accurate
      assessment of efficacy
