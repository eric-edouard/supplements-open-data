  abstract:
    - "Lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation is a safe strategy for improving visual performance of AMD patients, which mainly showed in a dose-response relationship."
    - "Xanthophyll carotenoids supplementation was associated with significant decrease in logMAR levels compared with the placebo group (WMD, -0.04; 95% CI, -0.06 to -0.03), and during intervention, each 1-mg/day increase in these carotenoids supplementation was related to a 0.003 reduction in logMAR level of VA."
