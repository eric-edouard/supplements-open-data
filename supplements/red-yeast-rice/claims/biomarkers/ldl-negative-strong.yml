  abstract:
    - "Compared with nutraceutical, RYR significantly reduced TC (MD, −17.80; 95% CI, −27.12 to −8.48; p = 0.0002) and LDL-C (MD, −14.40; 95% CI, −22.71 to −6.09; p = 0.0007)"
    - "Moreover, RYR effectively synergized nutraceutical to further reduce LDL-C (MD, −27.91; 95% CI, −36.58 to −19.24; p < 0.00001)"
    - "RYR at 200–4800 mg daily appears to be a safe and effective treatment for hyperlipidemia"
