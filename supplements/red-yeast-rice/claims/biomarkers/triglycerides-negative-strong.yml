  abstract:
    - In comparison to statins, RYR was more effective in lowering TG (MD,
      −19.90; 95% CI, −32.22 to −7.58; p = 0.002)
    - Moreover, RYR effectively synergized nutraceutical to further reduce TC
      (MD, −31.10; 95% CI, −38.83 to −23.36; p < 0.00001), LDL-C (MD, −27.91;
      95% CI, −36.58 to −19.24; p < 0.00001), and TG (MD, −26.32; 95% CI, −34.05
      to −18.59; p < 0.00001)
    - RYR at 200–4800 mg daily appears to be a safe and effective treatment for
      hyperlipidemia, effectively regulating blood lipid levels with an
      exceptional impact on TG
