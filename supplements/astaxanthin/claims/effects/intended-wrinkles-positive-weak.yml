  abstract:
    - Oral ASX supplementation did not significantly decrease wrinkle depth (SMD
      = −0.26; 95% CI = −0.58, 0.06; I2 = 0%; p = 0.11) compared to placebo
    - Ingestion and/or topical usages of ASX may be effective in reducing skin
      ageing and have promising cosmetical potential, as it improves moisture
      content and elasticity and reduces wrinkles
