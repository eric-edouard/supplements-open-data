  abstract:
    - "Random-effect model analysis was performed: TG (SMD: 0.94; 95%CI: 0.49,1.38; p = <0.0001), TC (SMD: 0.61; 95%CI: 0.27,0.95; p = 0.0005), LDL (SMD: 0.54; 95%CI: 0.17,0.91; p = 0.004), HDL (SMD: 0.29; 95%CI: 0.10,0.49; p = 0.003), HOMA-IR (SMD: 1.26; 95%CI: 0.83,1.70; p < 0.00001), and FPG (SMD: 1.11; 95%CI: 0.69,1.53; p < 0.00001) showed significant improvements with berberine treatment alone"
