  abstract:
    - "Glycemic metabolisms were the main factors studied, including glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c), fasting plasm glucose (FPG), and 2-hour postprandial blood glucose (2hPG). Insulin resistance was estimated by fasting blood insulin (FINS), homeostasis model assessment-insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), and body mass index (BMI). Lipid profiles were also assessed, including triglyceride (TG), total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL), and high-density lipoprotein (HDL)"
