    - After 2 years, while cognition remained stable in lithium treated
      patients, as evidenced by common cognition scales, patients receiving
      placebo exhibited continuous decline
    - 4 years into the study, five out of 31 subjects in the lithium group and 9
      out of 30 under placebo had progressed to dementia
    - a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of low-dose lithium among
      patients with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) aimed at slowing cognitive
      decline
effect: memory-formation
