  abstract:
    - "These findings indicate that the use of CS at doses of 3 g and 5 g/day for a short period (35 days) is safe and did not impair the kidneys or renal function in young healthy subjects."
    - "After 35 days of intervention, all characteristics were maintained without significant difference (P > 0.05) between the groups, including serum creatinine, eGFR, and more sensitive kidney biomarker concentrations (KIM-1 and MCP-1)."
