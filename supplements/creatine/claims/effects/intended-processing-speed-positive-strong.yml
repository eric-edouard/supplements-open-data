  abstract:
    - Our results show that creatine induces changes in PCr/Pi, ATP, tCr/tNAA, prevents a drop in pH level, and improves cognitive performance and processing speed.
    - subjects were orally administered a high single dose of creatinemonohydrate (0.35 g/kg) while performing cognitive tests during sleep deprivation
timing: single_dose
effect: processing-speed
kind: intended
direction: positive
strength: strong
