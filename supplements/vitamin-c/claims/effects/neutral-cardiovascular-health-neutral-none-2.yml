  abstract:
    - The composite endpoint, major CVD events was not different between the
      vitamin C and placebo group (hazard ratio (HR) 0.99, 95% confidence
      interval (CI) 0.89 to 1.10; 1 study; 14,641 participants; low-quality
      evidence)
    - Currently, there is no evidence to suggest that vitamin C supplementation
      reduces the risk of CVD in healthy participants and those at increased
      risk of CVD
