  abstract:
    - "Our meta-analysis of clinical trials and prospective cohort studies demonstrates that MVM supplementation does not improve cardiovascular outcomes in the general population."
    - "Overall, there was no association between MVM supplementation and CVD mortality (relative risk [RR], 1.00; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.97–1.04), CHD mortality (RR, 1.02; 95% CI, 0.92–1.13), stroke mortality (RR, 0.95; 95% CI, 0.82–1.09), or stroke incidence (RR, 0.98; 95% CI, 0.91–1.05)."
