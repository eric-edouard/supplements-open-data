  abstract:
    - "MVM supplementation improved vitamin C and zinc status in blood and self-reported health-status without altering measures of immune function or status or vitamin D levels, suggesting that healthy older adults may benefit from MVM supplementation."
    - "To test this hypothesis, we provided healthy older adults with either an MVM supplement formulated to improve immune function (RedoxonÂ® VI, Singapore) or an identical, inactive placebo control to take daily for 12 weeks."
