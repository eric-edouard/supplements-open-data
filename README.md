## 🗂️ Supplement metadata `meta.yml`

| key | type | required | example |
|-----|------|----------|---------|
| `slug` | string | ✔︎ | `creatine` |
| `name` | string | ✔︎ | `Creatine Monohydrate` |
| `synonyms` | string[] | – | `[creatine, creapure]` |
| `dosage_unit` | ✔︎ | microgram / milligram / gram / millilitre / IU  | `gram` |
| `created` | date | auto | |

Everything else lives in **claim files** so we always know which paper says what.

Example:
```yaml
slug: l-theanine
name: L-Theanine
synonyms: [theanine, suntheanine, liposomal theanine]
dosage_unit: milligram
created: 2025-01-15
```

## 📑 Claim files

### File Naming Convention

To keep the dataset clean, descriptive, and audit-friendly, every claim file follows this naming convention based on the claim content:

🔹 **Effects:** `{kind}-{effect}-{direction}-{strength}.yml`
🔹 **Biomarkers:** `{biomarker}-{direction}-{strength}.yml`
🔹 **Interactions:** `{target}-{danger_level}.yml`
🔹 **Formulations:** `{formulation}-{change|change_percent}pct.yml`
🔹 **Toxicity:** `{threshold_amount}mg-toxicity.yml`
🔹 **Cycles:** `{on_off_pattern}-cycle.yml`
🔹 **Synergies:** `{with_compound}-{strength|change_percent}pct.yml`
🔹 **Addiction-withdrawal:** `{symptom_slug}.yml`

#### Examples

**Effects:**
```
intended-muscle-strength-positive-strong.yml
intended-sleep-quality-positive-moderate.yml
adverse-nausea-negative-weak.yml
```

**Biomarkers:**
```
blood-glucose-negative-strong.yml
cortisol-negative-moderate.yml
crp-negative-strong.yml
```

**Interactions:**
```
warfarin-mild.yml
caffeine-low.yml
aspirin-severe.yml
```

**Formulations:**
```
liposomal-positive.yml
enteric-coated-neutral.yml
time-release-120pct.yml
```

**Toxicity:**
```
1000mg-toxicity.yml
500mg-toxicity.yml
gi-distress-toxicity.yml
```

**Cycles:**
```
5-2-cycle.yml              # 5 days on, 2 days off
8w-4w-cycle.yml           # 8 weeks on, 4 weeks off
none-cycle.yml            # no cycling needed
```

**Synergies:**
```
citrulline-strong.yml
vitamin-d-120pct.yml
magnesium-moderate.yml
```

**Addiction-withdrawal:**
```
rebound-insomnia.yml
tolerance.yml
withdrawal-anxiety.yml
```

#### 🧾 Why this format?

	•	**Content-descriptive:** File name immediately tells you what the claim is about
	•	**No external dependencies:** Don't need to look up publication dates
	•	**Filesystem-safe:** No special characters or dates that could be incorrect
	•	**Human-readable:** Easy to understand what each file contains at a glance
	•	**Sortable:** Claims group naturally by type and effect

⚠️ **Handling duplicates:** If multiple claims have identical names, suffix with -2, -3, etc.

intended-muscle-strength-positive-strong-2.yml
